# EV Specs

Note: this project is early in development and therefore is buggy.  There are locations with placeholder text and code.  Thanks for checking it out anyway!! 

Project is currently deployed on Vercel:  https://evspecs.vercel.app/specs

## Description
This website is a platform for searching Electric Vehicles and finding detailed specifications on them.  The endgoal is to provide a wealth of information about EVs pulled in from outside APIs, as well as the ability to to parse, search, and filter this information in multiple ways depending on user inputs.
